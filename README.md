### Running the project locally
`npm install` to install all of the dependencies
`npm start` to start the project

## Roadmap

MVP: 
- [x] Fetch data from SpaceX GraphQL api using apollo-clietn & GraphQL
- [x] Impletmented filter 
- [x] Implemented sort 
- [x] Simple unit tests

Future improvements:
- [ ] Implement pagination (performance improvement)
- [ ] Add more tests (filter and sort)
- [ ] Utilizing hooks (useMemo and useEffect)
- [ ] Refactor functions into smaller components
- [ ] Update type from any to correct types
- [ ] Beautify with CSS and mui library

Challenges: 
- Some of the ids from the API are duplicate therefore can't be use as key for mapping, otherwise will generate error on sorting and filtering. Decided to use index for key instead. Another option could be `crypto.randomUUID()` function - but might affect performance. 
- Issue with TypeScript not recognizing string as possible index value. Temp fix > use any.
