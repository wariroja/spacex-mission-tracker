      "details": "Total payload mass was 2,034 kg (4,484 lb) : 11 satellites weighing 172 kg each, plus a 142-kg mass simulator. This was the first launch of the upgraded v1.1 variant (later called Falcon 9 Full Thrust), with a 30 percent power increase. Orbcomm had originally agreed to be the third flight of the enhanced-thrust rocket, but the change to the maiden flight position was announced in October 2015. SpaceX received a permit from the FAA to land the booster on solid ground at Cape Canaveral, and succeeded."

Following second-stage separation from the first stage, an attempt was made to perform an ocean touchdown test of the discarded booster vehicle. The test provided good test data on the experiment-its primary objective-but as the booster neared the ocean, aerodynamic forces caused an uncontrollable roll. The center engine, depleted of fuel by centrifugal force, shut down resulting in the impact and destruction of the vehicle."

Per satellite, launch costs were less than $30 million. The ABS satellite reached its final destination ahead of schedule and started operations on September 10."
